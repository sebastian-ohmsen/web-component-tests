# Web Components test

This repository is a demo for test purposes. The goal is to test the usage and possible build process for web components. 

## Getting started

Type: 

```bash
npm install
```

to install all necessary dependencies.

To build the project type:

```bash
npm run build 
```

This will generate all necessary files and copy them to the *dist* folder. Open the *index.html* to display the results.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command starts a development server and opens a browser window with the corresponding URL. The build system monitors all sources and refreshes the browser when changes are made.
